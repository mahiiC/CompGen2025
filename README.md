# Introduction - CompGen 2025
This repository contains the code used for the "Compgen-2025" course, a hands-on Computational Genomics workshop organized by the Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, 
Max Delbrück Center, Berlin, Germany. This workshop was expertly led by the instructors: Dr. Altuna Akalın, Dr. Artür Manukyan, Dr. Bora Uyar, and other outstanding instructors 
from the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC) Berlin. The course blends theoretical lectures with hands-on programming exercises, primarily using R and Python.
Apart from documenting my progress, this repository also includes the code implementations where I apply the knowledge gained from the course to real-world datasets. THis course also invloved the usage of an online compute platform provided by rolv.io ([https://www.rolv.io/](https://www.rolv.io/))
